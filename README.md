# KazusaGI_cb2
 Server sofware reimplementaion for an old version of a certain anime game

## Please note: the project is still WIP and is in its very early stages, and many features might not work as intended. Same with the code quality, it will go through many rewrites and refactoring in the future, so please don't judge :\)

# Usage
- Compile via Visual Studio 2022
- Download `BinOutput`, `Lua` and `ExcelBinOutput` from [the resources repo](https://github.com/Hiro420/KazusaGI_Data) and place them in `resources` folder, next to the executable
- Download [0.7.1](https://autopatchhk.yuanshen.com/client_app/pc_plus19/Genshin_0.7.1.zip) or [0.7.0](https://autopatchhk.yuanshen.com/client_app/pc_plus19/Genshin_0.7.0.zip) version of a certain anime game 
- Place a patched [mhyprot2.Sys](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1105125107506102373/1335738261146177688/mhyprot2.Sys?ex=67a142b2&is=679ff132&hm=a79280fc566301ca8ccaf9e3f03449808d5940217bbd3745de59854331cca69c&) in the game folder, next to the executable
- [Download](https://api.getfiddler.com/fc/latest) and [configure](#Configure-Fiddler) Fiddler
- Profit

- Press `Save Script`, a sound indicating success should be heard.

### Personal TODO List
- implement DungeonEntryInfoReq
- implement Gacha
- implement basic ScriptLib
- load scenes from group suits
- NOT load quest-related lua groups
